# Deployment Troubleshooting Log

## Issue: 500 INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR - MIDDLEWARE_INVOCATION_FAILED

**Error Details:**
- Code: `MIDDLEWARE_INVOCATION_FAILED`

## Root Cause Analysis

The error was initially thought to be related to missing Clerk environment variables, but investigation revealed:

1. **All Clerk environment variables are properly set in Vercel:**
   - ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
   - ✅ `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
   - ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL`
   - ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL`
   - ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL`
   - ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL`
   - ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PROXY_URL`
   - ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_IS_SATELLITE`
   - ✅ `CLERK_DEBUG`
   - ⚠️ `NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_CLERK` (was set to `true` - its now removed)

2. **Secondary Issue Found:** Blog page was making API calls during build time
   - Error: `Route /blog couldn't be rendered statically because it used revalidate: 0 fetch http://localhost:3000/api/blog/posts`
   - This was causing build-time failures

## Attempted Solutions

### ✅ Solution 1: Fixed Blog Page (SUCCESSFUL)
**File:** `src/app/blog/page.tsx`
**Changes:**
- Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`
- This prevents static generation and build-time API calls
- **Result:** Blog page now renders dynamically at request time

### ❌ Solution 2: Environment Variable Checks (FAILED)
**File:** `middleware.ts`
**Attempted:**
- Added environment variable validation
- Added fallback middleware when Clerk not configured
- **Result:** Still got `MIDDLEWARE_INVOCATION_FAILED`

### ❌ Solution 3: Async/Await Removal (FAILED)
**File:** `middleware.ts`
**Attempted:**
- Removed `async/await` from Clerk middleware callback
- Changed `await auth.protect()` to `auth.protect()`
- **Result:** Still got `MIDDLEWARE_INVOCATION_FAILED`

### ✅ Solution 4: Temporary Clerk Disable (CURRENT WORKING SOLUTION)
**File:** `middleware.ts`
**Changes:**
- Completely removed Clerk middleware
- Replaced with basic Next.js middleware
- Admin routes now redirect to home page
- **Result:** Deployment succeeds, site is functional

## Current Status

### ✅ Working:
- Site deploys successfully
- All public pages work
- Blog page renders correctly
- No more `MIDDLEWARE_INVOCATION_FAILED` errors

### ⚠️ Temporarily Disabled:
- Admin authentication (routes redirect to home)
- Clerk integration completely disabled

## Suspected Root Cause

**Compatibility Issue:** Clerk v6.32.0 with Next.js 15.5.2
- The `clerkMiddleware` function appears to have compatibility issues with Next.js 15.5.2
- This is likely a known issue that needs to be addressed by either:
  1. Updating Clerk to a newer version
  2. Downgrading Next.js to a more stable version (15.0.x)
  3. Waiting for Clerk to release a compatibility fix

## Next Steps to Re-enable Authentication

### Option 1: Update Clerk (Recommended)
```bash
npm update @clerk/nextjs
```

### Option 2: Downgrade Next.js
```bash
npm install next@15.0.3
```

### Option 3: Check Clerk Documentation
- Look for Next.js 15.5.x compatibility notes
- Check if there are specific configuration requirements

## Files Modified

1. **`src/app/blog/page.tsx`**
   - Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`
   - Fixed build-time API call issues

2. **`middleware.ts`**
   - Temporarily disabled Clerk middleware
   - Added basic admin route protection

## Environment Variables to Check

In Vercel Dashboard, ensure:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_CLERK` is removed or set to `false`
- All other Clerk variables remain as configured

## Commits Made

1. `5b45c76` - Fix middleware and blog page deployment issues
2. `a3c7d40` - Remove async/await from Clerk middleware to fix invocation error  
3. `4286168` - Temporarily disable Clerk middleware to fix deployment
4. `703a839` - Re-enable Clerk middleware with updated configuration
5. `28e736d` - Downgrade Next.js to 15.1.0 for Clerk compatibility

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Site deploys without errors
- [ ] Public pages load correctly
- [ ] Blog page displays posts
- [ ] Admin routes redirect to home (expected behavior)
- [ ] No console errors in browser

## Future Investigation

When re-enabling Clerk:
1. Test with latest Clerk version
2. Check Next.js compatibility matrix
3. Review Clerk's Next.js 15 migration guide
4. Consider using Clerk's newer middleware patterns if available
